# Project Reports

Each Udacity project is accompanied by a report. Each report follows a similar structure of explaining the algorithm used, what sort of challanges arose during development, the final results and suggestions for future improvements. You can find the detailed reports for each project in the `doc` folder:

- [Project: Navigation](doc/Report_p1_navigation.md)
- [Project: Continuous Control](doc/Report_p2_continuous.md)
